# Deep_Learning
Implemented Tensorflow's NN in order to create a binary classifier for successful or unsuccessful organizations. 

Involved cleaning original CSV with Pandas binning. What followed was using a Nueral Net to model the data. 

After only achieving .725 accuracy, several attempts were made to get the accuracy above .75. 

This included using PCA to reduce dimensions, binning the data in various ways, unbinning the data, and using Keras's Tuner to find optimal parameters. 

The highest accuracy reached through extensive experimentation was around .735.
